Python - Classes and Objects


In Python, and many other programming languages, a class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them, defined by methods.

A class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. These attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

Here's a very basic example of a class in Python:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")
```

In this example, `Dog` is the class. The `__init__` method is a special method that Python calls when it creates a new instance of the class. `self` refers to the instance of the class. The `bark` method is an instance method, which can perform operations that utilize instance variables.

An object is an instance of a class. For example, you could create an instance of the `Dog` class like this:

```python
my_dog = Dog("Fido", "Labrador")
```

In this case, `my_dog` is an object of the class `Dog`. You can access its variables and methods using dot notation:

```python
print(my_dog.name)  # prints: Fido
print(my_dog.breed) # prints: Labrador
my_dog.bark()       # prints: Woof!
```

In Python, everything is an object, and everything can have attributes and methods. All functions have a built-in attribute `__doc__`, which returns the docstring defined in the function's source code. Even data types are classes which are just instances of the object type.
