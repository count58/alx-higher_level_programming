Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Data Structures in Python

In Python, a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Python has four basic inbuilt data structures - Lists, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set.

Lists

A List in Python is a collection of items. These items can be of any type (strings, integers, other lists, etc.) and a single list can contain items of different types. Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate items.

Lists are created by putting items (elements) inside square brackets [], separated by commas

Tuples

A Tuple in Python is similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples are unchangeable, or immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content.

Tuples are created by putting items (elements) inside parentheses (), separated by commas

To summarize, lists and tuples in Python are both sequence types that can store a collection of items. They can store items of any type and can even store items of different types within the same list or tuple. The main difference between them is that lists are mutable (i.e., their content can be changed after creation), while tuples are immutable (i.e., their content cannot be changed after creation).
