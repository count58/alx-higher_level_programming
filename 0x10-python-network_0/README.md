Python Network is a term used to refer to the use of the Python programming language to build applications that can communicate over a network. Python is a general-purpose programming language, but it has a number of features that make it well-suited for network programming, including:

It is a high-level language, which means that it is relatively easy to learn and use, even for programmers who do not have a lot of experience with network programming.
It has a large and active community of developers, which means that there is a lot of support and documentation available online.
It has a rich standard library, which includes a number of modules that can be used for network programming, such as the socket module and the httplib module.
It is a portable language, which means that Python code can be run on a variety of different platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Python Network can be used to build a wide range of network applications, including:

Web servers
Chat applications
File transfer applications
Network monitoring tools
Games
And more
Here are some examples of Python Network libraries:

requests: A library for making HTTP requests.
